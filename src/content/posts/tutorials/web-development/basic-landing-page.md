## Intro

There are many ways a web developer use to make a website. And for (not really) beginner, here's my approach to make a Landing Page Website. Because there's so much to explain and I'm too lazy to write it all here, I just threw the video here. Also, please leave a like and subscribe to my channel :v

### - Planning

Make it simple. Use anything to draw a sketch of your website. You can use software like Figma, CorelDraw or even draw it on paper. Make sure that your sketch are easy for you to code it to a real website later.

### - Tools Setup

I recommend that you use VS Code, because it has some features that will make your life easier (mostly Emmet). If you already using VS Code, make sure you have the essential extensions for web development, such as `Live Server`, `Auto Rename Tag` and `Prettier`.
